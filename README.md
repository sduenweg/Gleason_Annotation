# Gleason_Annotation
MATLAB scripts to generate a ML-based automated Gleason annotation using calculated histomorphometric features, as well as Python scripts to create a similar tool using raw, annotated histology.

Please note that Python scripts (converted to .onnx files) were too large to be uploaded here. Please email sduenweg@mcw.edu for access to these scripts.
